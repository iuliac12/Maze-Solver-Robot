# Maze Solver Robot

<details>
  <summary> <h2>  Introduction </h2> </summary>
  
##
  
  This project brings the concept of autonomous navigation into the real world. Building a maze solver robot that can detect and navigate through mazes using sensors and algorithms â€” all powered by an Arduino microcontroller. 
  
This project combines hardware assembly and software development, making it a hands-on learning experience for enthusiasts interested in robotics, microcontrollers, and problem-solving. By leveraging sensors, algorithms, and microcontroller programming, a maze solver robot can effectively detect and avoid obstacles, map its environment, and reach its destination efficiently.
