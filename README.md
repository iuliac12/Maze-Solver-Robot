# Maze Solver Robot

<details>
  <summary> <h2>  Introduction </h2> </summary>
  
##
  
  This project brings the concept of autonomous navigation into the real world. Building a maze solver robot that can detect and navigate through mazes using sensors and algorithms â€” all powered by an Arduino microcontroller. 
  
This project combines hardware assembly and software development, making it a hands-on learning experience for enthusiasts interested in robotics, microcontrollers, and problem-solving. By leveraging sensors, algorithms, and microcontroller programming, a maze solver robot can effectively detect and avoid obstacles, map its environment, and reach its destination efficiently.

  <summary> <h2> General Description </h2> </summary>

  ##
  
The maze solver robot consists of several interconnected modules: a power supply to energize the system, sensors for obstacle detection, a microcontroller to process data and implement the maze-solving algorithm, a motor driver to control wheel motion, and actuators to enable movement. These modules work together to ensure the robot can detect walls, decide the optimal direction, and navigate through the maze autonomously. The ultrasonic sensors continuously relay distance measurements to the microcontroller, which interprets the data, computes the next move, and sends corresponding commands to the motors.
